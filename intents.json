Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to recreate traditional financial systems, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without the need for intermediaries. Digital identity is the representation of identity information in a digital format, enabling secure and efficient online authentication and verification."
